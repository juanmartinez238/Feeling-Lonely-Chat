## Features

- Typing a message into the text input and hitting enter creates a message in the chatbox.
- The text box is cleared out when enter is pressed to make room for the next message.
- The message is always from either "Me", "Myself", or "I".
- The message is timestamped.
- Clicking an X by the message deletes the message.
- Clicking the "I feel lonely" button makes an API request to the [Internet Chuck Norris Joke Database](http://www.icndb.com/) -- specificially, to the random joke endpoint: https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random.
